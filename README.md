# Project overview

Currency exchanger - is a mobile application built with React Native. It's purpose is to fetch currency rates from public api and allow you to save your favorite rates that are available even in offline mode.

## Technical description

### Architecture is modular

It's typical for mobile apps. Allows to explicitly separate concerns of the project, for example *components* folder that contains minimal UI building blocks that are being used across the app or *modules* folder that contains bussiness logic of the app.

### App structure

App consists of two screens, List and Favorites. Navigation between the screens is managed with **bottom tabs navigation**. Each screen displays a list of currencies and their rates. List screen shows list of every currency available and Favorites screen shows only favorite ones.

Major components that are used accross the app are:

- Loader - shows ActivitiIndicator component while data is being fetched
- Tile.Currency - tile of the list that shows currency and it's rate
- Icon - renders icons based on name passed as prop

### Offline mode implementation

Offline mode is implemented with the help of redux persistor and async storage. Each time data is fetched from the remote, at first it is saved to async storage and then it's being selected from the local storage to be displayed on screens.

Both favorites and last fetched items are saved, therefore both of the list are available offline.

### Libraries used

- React Navigation - navigation
- React Redux - state management
- Redux Saga - side effect manager
- Reac Native Fast Image - optimized loading of currency icons
- Axios - API requests
- React Native Svg - rendering of svg icons

## Getting Started

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
